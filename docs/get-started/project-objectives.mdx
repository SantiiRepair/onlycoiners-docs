# ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

Currently with a 1% tax that can be turned off, what we want is to attract a large user base for self-sustainability with the tax and a focus on continuous development to benefit our users.

Our goal is to maintain an active and satisfied user base, ensuring the long-term success of our project. To achieve this, we offer a variety of exclusive features and benefits for registered users.

In the area of development, we strive to constantly improve the software quality and offer an outstanding user experience. To do this, we have a highly skilled and experienced development team that works tirelessly to solve problems and implement new features.

As for communication and user support, we also aim to provide an exceptional user experience. We offer effective communication channels, such as forums and notification systems, allowing users to quickly and efficiently express their concerns and concerns. Additionally, we have a highly skilled support team that is available to help users with any problems they may encounter.

In summary, our long-term approach is to attract a large user base, offer them an exceptional user experience, and stay focused on continuous development and improvement of the software. By achieving this, we believe we can remain financially sustainable and ensure the long-term success of our project.
