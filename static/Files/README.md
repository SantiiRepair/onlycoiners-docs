Other tokens can be included more and say that if they want their token included here, feel free to contact the support email.

Include also we plan to support the other Ethereum variants like BSC and others. When we support the other blockchain we will support USDC and USDT by default and we might include OnlyCoin suppor there as well. Please include that is one of our plans.

Include also we plan to support more blockchains like Solana, TON from Telegram etc.

Please also state that these wallets will all work and we are trustable.

Do we have a roadmap or something at the docs? If it hasn't yet please include that we will support other blockchains for wallets and will have community and group chat support.
