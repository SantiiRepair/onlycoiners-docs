## Requirements

If you have other suggestions it will be included here.

- Tokenomics including the Onlycoin token, where they can trade, tax, total amount etc and purpose of it being a utiliy token 
- Website features including profile, post, chat, wallet and others
- Multi language support including English, Spanish and Portuguese
- Deployment should be done at docs.onlycoiners.com

## Your first tasks

You might have a collaborlator that will work with you to support other languages. Consider that in mind.

1. Let us know which docs framework will be used. It is better to have multi language support from the beginning.
2. Find some utility token docs website examples that you might think that will fit for our docs website.
3. Set up the CI / CD env for the docs website first. It doesn't have to be working at docs.onlycoiners.com to start but there should be a link so we can see the progress.
