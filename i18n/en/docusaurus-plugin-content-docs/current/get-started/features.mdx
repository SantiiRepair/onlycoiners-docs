Once registered, each user is assigned a unique referral link. This link contains a special code that identifies them as the referrer.

Users can share their referral link with friends, family, or anyone they think might be interested in joining our platform. They can do this through various channels such as social media, email, or direct messaging.

Our system tracks all referrals made by each user through their unique referral link. This allows us to accurately attribute new registrations to the respective referrers.

Overall, our referral system is designed to encourage users to spread the word about our platform while rewarding them for their efforts in bringing new members onboard. It helps us grow our user base organically while providing benefits to both referrers and referred users alike.
